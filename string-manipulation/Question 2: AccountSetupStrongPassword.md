# Account Setup Strong Password

This application should prompt the user for a username and password. The username should be converted to all lowercase letters.

The program should keep prompting the user for a password until it is a _**strong**_ password.

A strong password is one that is 8 characters long, has at least one uppercase letter and one digit.

It should then echo back the username and password for confirmation purposes.

Please note that the sample input's provided are an example of one part of the program, without the while loop.
