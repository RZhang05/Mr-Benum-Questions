# Name Reverser
## Idea

We can easily do this by taking two strings by using `sc.next()` which only reads a single word.

After, we can output the two string variables, with a comma after the `lastword` variable, followed by the `firstword` variable.

## Pseudocode

```
input(firstword)
input(secondword)

output(secondWord + ", " + firstWord)
```
