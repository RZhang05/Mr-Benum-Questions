# Account Setup

This application should prompt the user for a username and password. The username should be converted to all lowercase letters. The program should keep prompting the user for a password until it is 8 characters long. It should then echo back the username and password for confirmation purposes.

(Please note that because this is a prompt & output question, all things inputted will have a ">" before the line).
## Sample Console 1
```
Please enter a username:
> hello

Please enter a password:
> world

Not long enough! The password must be 8 characters long.

Please enter a username:
> hello

Please enter a password:
> world1234

Confirmation:
Username: hello
password: world1234
```
