# Random Name Picker
Create a program that reads a class list of `names from a file` and will **randomly** select a name from the list. The name should pop up in a [JOptionPane.showOptionDialog](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/dialog.html) and the user will be able to press **Yes** to continue picking more random names, or **No** to quit using the `System.exit(1) command`.
