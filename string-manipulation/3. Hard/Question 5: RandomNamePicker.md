# Random Name Picker
Create a program that reads a class list of `names from a file` and will **randomly** select a name from the list. The name should pop up in a [JOptionPane.showOptionDialog](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/dialog.html) and the user will be able to press **Yes** to continue picking more random names, or **No** to quit using the `System.exit(1) command`.

## Things to know
Note that these are only included in one possible solution, there could and most possibly are more solutions to this problem.
This is essentially the same as the question before.
1. [Files](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html)
2. [FileReader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/FileReader.html)
3. [BufferedReader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html)
4. [JOptionPane](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/dialog.html)

## Sample Run
### Pop up Dialog Box
*Will not resemble the below* :+1:
```
         \\\///
        / _  _ \
      (| (.)(.) |)
.---.OOOo--()--oOOO.---.

|     Randomize?       |
|     Yes     No       |
|                      |
'---.oooO--------------'
     (   )   Oooo.
      \ (    (   )
       \_)    ) /
             (_/

```
