# Comma Separated Values
A **CSV type file** is one that separates values using commas, for the purpose of putting values into cells in a spreadsheet such as Excel. This program should take a **csv type file** and display the information in a console window using `\t` to separate the information that would normally be in the cells.

## Pseudocode :bulb:
```
Read in the .csv file as per normal
for (each line) {
    Split each line by ','
    Output the result in a table format 
}
```
