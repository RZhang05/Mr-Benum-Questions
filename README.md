# Mr-Benum-Questions

Hello! I'm Jonathan Sumabat, and I'm just adding a bunch of questions from Mr. Benum's computer science class to this, as well as some sample inputs and outputs so you can test it. Even so, I still recommend that you try to make your own test cases in order to find corner cases.

As for solutions to the problems, they will NOT be written in java, but will be provided in pseudocode. You should only use the suggested method of solving the problem if you're stuck and unable to figure out what to do next. Some solutions may not be written in pseudocode and will instead provide the outline on how you should solve the problem.

If you find a problem, please leave an issue [here](https://github.com/MisterCookiez/Mr-Benum-Questions/issues).
