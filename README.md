# Mr-Benum-Questions

Hello! I'm Jonathan Sumabat, and I'm just adding a bunch of questions from Mr. Benum's computer science class to this, as well as some sample inputs and outputs so you can test it. Even so, I still recommend that you try to make your own test cases in order to find corner cases.

As for solutions to the problems, they will NOT be written in java, but be provided in pseudocode. You should only be using it if you are stuck, and if you're not sure on what to do next or not (sometimes, it will just tell you on the basic idea on how to do the question, possibly not even providing a pseudocode for it).

If you find a problem, please leave an issue [here](https://github.com/MisterCookiez/Mr-Benum-Questions/issues).
