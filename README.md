# Mr-Benum-Questions

Hello! I'm Jonathan Sumabat, and I'm just adding a bunch of questions from Mr. Benum's computer science class to this, as well as some sample inputs and outputs so you can test it. Even so, I still recommend that you try to make your own test cases in order to find corner cases.

If you find a problem, please leave an issue [here](https://github.com/MisterCookiez/Mr-Benum-Questions/issues).
